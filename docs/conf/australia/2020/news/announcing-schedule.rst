Announcing the full conference schedule
=======================================

Hello folks!

We're less than two months away from the first online Australia and India conference and we're working hard to make sure it'll be as welcoming and as fun as the in-person event you're probably familiar with.

Today, we're announcing the full presentation schedule and the platform we'll be hosting the conference on.
We are working on more details for a few more activities during the conference, so keep an eye out for more information in our next mailing.

Conference platform
--------------------

The conference will be held on https://hopin.to/. This platform not only provides a stage for our amazing speakers, but also has integrated chat, unconference rooms with breakout calls, expo booths, and even a virtual hallway.
We're updating our Welcome Wagon guide, to be released soon, so it'll all feel familiar before you've even "hopped in" (pun unintended).

IMPORTANT: Please watch your inboxes during the next weeks for an email with a registration link to Hopin.
We recommend that you register for the platform in advance, to avoid any last minute snafus.

Full presentation schedule
--------------------------

The conference website is now updated with the `talk schedule <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/schedule/>`_ for the main stage presentations, so you can start planning your time (and getting excited!) for the conference. We're excited to have live Q&A after most talks, which will come from your questions but be moderated by an MC.

All our events and activities
-----------------------------

Write the Docs is more than a conference. Every year we make sure to have a variety of activities that our attendees can enjoy, whether you want to learn something, meet new people, or share knowledge. And even though this years conference is held online, we're holding to that plan.

* **Lightning Talks.** We'll have `lightning talks <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/{{year}}/lightning-talks/>`__ each day after lunch. These are 5 minute presentations and a lot of fun. They can be about anything you want, this is your chance to share something you are passionate about with the audience. Slides are not required.
* **Unconference.** We'll be running the `Unconference <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/{{year}}/unconference/>`_ all day Monday and on Tuesday afternoon. Want to chat with like-minded folks about a specific thing? This is the place.
* **Social event**. On Thursday night the conference platform will become the social event space. The main stage will be closed and the focus will be on attendee-created sessions. You're welcome to create sessions for board games, trivia quizzes, karaoke, or any other social activity that you want to share with your fellow documentarians.
* **Conference Help Desk**. If you have any questions about navigating the virtual event, we'll be running the Write the Docs Helpdesk booth, where you can chat with one of the organizers and the Welcome Wagon team.

The `Schedule page <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/australia/{{year}}/schedule/>`_ has the latest and most complete information about all our events. This is where we will also update any changes/cancellations if they should occur.

Thanks so much for all your support and enthusiasm so far â€“ we're so excited to see you all in December!

The Write the Docs team
