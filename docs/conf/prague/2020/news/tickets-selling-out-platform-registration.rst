Tickets selling out and conference platform registration
========================================================

Hey everyone!

We're just shy of a week away from the start of the conference, and we're excited to invite you into our online venue for 3 days of content, collaboration, and conversation.
Tickets are going to sell out in the next 24 hours, so if you've been on the fence now is the time to buy one!

We have done our internal testing of the platform and we're getting everything ready for prime time. This update includes information about accessing the conference platform and other recommendations that will help you make the most of the conference. 


Tickets will sell out tomorrow
------------------------------

We wanted to let you know that we expect tickets to sell out on **Octover 14th at 20:00 CEST**.
We've increased the capacity for this years even from previous years, but we still want to make sure the event keeps its manageable size and feel.
If you were hoping to come to this years event, we recommend that you `get your tickets soon <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2020/tickets/>`_.

**If you already purchased a ticket you should have gotten an email from us with your Hopin registration link.** After we stop ticket sales, we will send another email to everyone with a reminder and a link to access the Hopin event.

The Hopin access links will be sent to all Ti.to ticket holders, so monitor your inbox this week for a message. If you don't get an email from us by the end of the week, please check your spambox first, and then email us and we'll help you out.

Once you've got your Hopin ticket, you will be ready to get started on Sunday morning with the Writing Day!

Welcome Wagon Guide
-------------------

Each year we create a guide to help our attendees get the most out of the conference.
This year, we're all first-timers at an online event, so we've totally rewritten `our Welcome Wagon guide <https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/prague/2020/welcome-wagon/>`_ to help you get the most out of our event this year.

We have a lot of information about how to use Hopin, and lots of tips and tricks for the best way to plan your days.
We've taken all the transit and travel information out, but please do plan to spend a large part of your day with us from the comfort of your own home.

Shirts still on sale
--------------------

The `Write the Docs Prague 2020 Pop-Up Shop <https://teespring.com/wtd-prague-2020>`_ is still open! We have loose and fitted options from different fabrics, and you can choose exactly the size and cut you want.

The campaign will run in 3-day batches until **November 30th**. Shipping is available from the USA or Europe. However, due to the global shipping situation, we recommend you order your shirt at least 2-3 weeks in advance if you want to sport your new threads during the conference.


Thanks again to all our sponsors
--------------------------------

We are so grateful to have our sponsors help in bringing these events to life every year. 
You'll be able to chat with most of our sponsors at the Job Fair, and a few will have booths for conversations the entire conference.

Thanks so much to the following companies for supporting the Portland conference this year:
